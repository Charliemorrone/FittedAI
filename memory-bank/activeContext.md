- ✅ **Auto-refresh after 3 swipes** for immediate re-ranking from API
- ✅ **Dynamic project selection** based on user input (wedding/formal → A, else → B)

## Next Steps

1. Create splash screen for app launch
2. Create item detail screen that appears when clicking on outfit photos
3. Polish animations and micro-interactions
4. Add user preferences persistence
5. Testing with real Gray Whale API endpoints
6. Enhanced error handling and offline support

## Active Decisions

- **Architecture**: React Native with serverless approach
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen transitions
- **State Management**: React Context for global state
- **Image Handling**: Pre-built dataset for hackathon efficiency

## Current Blockers

- Need to initialize React Native project
- Gray Whale algorithm integration details
- Amazon API setup requirements

## Development Priorities

1. Core UI screens and navigation
2. Swipe gesture implementation
3. Basic recommendation flow
4. Purchase integration
5. Gray Whale algorithm integration

## Notes

- Focus on MVP for hackathon timeline
- Prioritize core functionality over polish
- Use pre-built images to avoid real-time generation complexity
- **Gray Whale API Config**: Set GRAY_WHALE_SERVER_URL, GRAY_WHALE_ORG_ID, GRAY_WHALE_ACCESS_TOKEN in app.json
- **Collections**: Local JSON file (collections.json) takes priority over API for demo purposes
- **Project Selection**: Keywords "wedding"/"formal" → Project A, others → Project B

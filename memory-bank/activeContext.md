# Active Context: FittedAI

## Current Focus
Core React Native frontend implementation complete. Ready for Gray Whale algorithm integration and testing.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Created memory bank structure
- ✅ Defined project requirements and technical approach
- ✅ Initialized React Native project with Expo
- ✅ Implemented all core screens (Input, Recommendation, Purchase)
- ✅ Set up navigation and swipe functionality
- ✅ Created service layer for Gray Whale and Amazon integration
- ✅ Defined TypeScript types and interfaces

## Next Steps
1. Test the app on simulator/device
2. Integrate real Gray Whale algorithm API
3. Set up Amazon API integration
4. Add pre-built image dataset
5. Implement user preferences persistence
6. Add error handling and loading states
7. Polish UI and user experience

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture**: React Native with serverless approach
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen transitions
- **State Management**: React Context for global state
- **Image Handling**: Pre-built dataset for hackathon efficiency

## Current Blockers
- Need to initialize React Native project
- Gray Whale algorithm integration details
- Amazon API setup requirements

## Development Priorities
1. Core UI screens and navigation
2. Swipe gesture implementation
3. Basic recommendation flow
4. Purchase integration
5. Gray Whale algorithm integration

## Notes
- Focus on MVP for hackathon timeline
- Prioritize core functionality over polish
- Use pre-built images to avoid real-time generation complexity

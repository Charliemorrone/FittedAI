## Active Decisions

- **Architecture**: React Native with serverless approach
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen transitions
- **State Management**: React Context for global state
- **Image Handling**: Pre-built dataset for hackathon efficiency

## Current Blockers

- Need to initialize React Native project
- Gray Whale algorithm integration details
- Amazon API setup requirements

## Development Priorities

1. Core UI screens and navigation
2. Swipe gesture implementation
3. Basic recommendation flow
4. Purchase integration
5. Gray Whale algorithm integration

## Notes

- Focus on MVP for hackathon timeline
- Prioritize core functionality over polish
- Use pre-built images to avoid real-time generation complexity

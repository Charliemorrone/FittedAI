# Progress: FittedAI

## What Works
- Project structure established
- Memory bank documentation complete
- Technical architecture defined
- Core requirements documented

## What's Left to Build
- [ ] Gray Whale algorithm integration (mock data implemented)
- [ ] Amazon API integration (mock data implemented)
- [ ] Pre-built image dataset setup
- [ ] Real-time recommendation updates
- [ ] User preferences persistence
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Testing and debugging

## Current Status
**Phase**: Core Implementation Complete
- React Native project initialized with Expo
- All main screens implemented (Input, Recommendation, Purchase)
- Navigation system set up
- Swipe gesture handling implemented
- Mock data services for Gray Whale and Amazon
- TypeScript types and interfaces defined
- Project structure organized

## Known Issues
- None yet (project just started)

## Next Milestones
1. **Phase 1**: React Native setup and basic navigation
2. **Phase 2**: Core screen implementations
3. **Phase 3**: Swipe functionality and recommendations
4. **Phase 4**: Purchase flow and integrations
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and polish

## Development Notes
- Using serverless approach for hackathon efficiency
- Pre-built image dataset to avoid real-time generation
- Focus on core functionality first, polish later
